# Py - Song cover with SOVITS voice cloning
This is a refactored code from the <a href="https://github.com/ardha27/AI-Song-Cover-SOVITS">original by ardha27</a>. <br>
The refactored code has 2 notebooks, for voice inference (if you already have a sovits model), and for training (voice cloning).

### Inference (if you already have sovits model)
